# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `bevy_puppet`!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.99 or later, and a nightly toolchain for formatting
- Git
- Familiarity with Bevy and its ECS
- [cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) and
  [cargo-machete](https://github.com/bnjbvr/cargo-machete), for the security
  and dependency checks

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly --component rustfmt
cargo install cargo-deny cargo-machete --locked
```

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/declaredlost/bevy_puppet.git
cd bevy_puppet
```

### Checks

These commands mirror the CI checks:

```bash
# Check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets

# Fix the formatting with nightly rustfmt
cargo +nightly fmt --all

# Clippy
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Tests
cargo test --workspace --all-features

# Unused dependencies
cargo machete

# Check advisories, licenses and sources with cargo-deny
cargo deny check all
```

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the [code style](#code-style)

3. Add tests for new behaviour

4. Ensure all checks pass

## Code Style

This project follows the standard Rust style guidelines:

- Format with nightly rustfmt (`cargo +nightly fmt --all`), which applies the
  import grouping in `rustfmt.toml`
- Ensure `cargo clippy` passes with no warnings; `clippy::pedantic` is denied
- Lint exceptions are `#[expect(..., reason = "...")]`, never `#[allow]`
- Add documentation comments (`///`) for every item; `missing_docs` is denied

## Submitting Changes

1. Commit with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
   messages, matching the repository labels:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add the thing"
   ```

2. Push your branch and open a Pull Request with:
   - A clear title describing the change
   - What changed and why
   - Related issues

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
- Ensure CI passes (format, clippy, tests, machete, deny)
- Label the PR with its type
